      <description>It is well known that convolutional neural networks (CNNs or ConvNets) have been the source of many major breakthroughs in the field of Deep learning in the last few years, but they are rather unintuitive to reason about for most people. I’ve always wanted to break down the parts of a ConvNet and see what an image looks like after each stage, and in this post I do just that!</description>
